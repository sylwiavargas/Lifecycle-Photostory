## Lifecycle photostory

**note:** this photostory was created as a part of a workshop on lifecycle methods:
* [git repo](https://github.com/sylwiavargas/lifecycle-methods-workshop)
* [video](https://youtu.be/MrBkhjE-YL0)

In the spirit of the 2000s nostalgia, I created a photostory that explains what each of the React 16 lifecycle methods is doing. If you're curious what a photostory is, it was something we used to do a lot in Germany and in Poland: [example](https://i2.wp.com/bravo-archiv-shop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2000-17-Engel-der-Gewalt.jpg?fit=800%2C535&ssl=1).
